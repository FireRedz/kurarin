    Overview:

        Shader program 'test':
            Get shader desc: test_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs_test
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_test_position = 0
                    ATTR_vs_test_color = 1
            Fragment shader: fs_test


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader test = sg_make_shader(test_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs_test':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_test_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_test_color] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]
