## what the fuck is this

this is where i put the game """engines""", all of them used the `framework` module.

### List of engines

```none
* osu! standard [playable]
* project sekai [view only, very wip, rarely updated]
* project diva arcade future tone [view only]
```

# Notes

## Project Sekai

You need a `.sus` file for the beatmap and a `audio.mp3` for the audio. </br>
Beatmap parsing is still somewhat wrong, god do I love obscure japanese file format.

## Project Diva

You need a `.dsc` file for the beatmap and a `audio.mp3` file in the same directory to make this whole thing work properly.
