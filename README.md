## About

This is actually one of my first [V](https://vlang.io) project and I barely know anything about programming graphics. (lies) <br/>
Just a heads up that this program will not work 100% of the time considering I made some questionable choices while making this but hey atleast it runs (sometimes) lol.

Anyway heres some screenshots I guess.

## Bugs

* The entire thing is a bug and error-prone
* Slider is not accurate at all since I barely put any time into it
* Storyboard is not accurate at all since I am stupid
* And so on...
