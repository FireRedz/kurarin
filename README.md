## Disclaimer

This is my personal side project so updates is very random.

## Why Dementia

Old codebase is absolute dogshit and full of weird shenanigans, so might as well make everything from scratch again ;). </br>
(New codebase is still bad but atleast its bearable and much more simpler this time)

## Preview

(Slider is being reworked, so theres no alpha)

## Building

### Requirements

* V
* BASS
* OpenGL >= 3.3 (iirc)

#### On Linux (Arch)

You might need to install a few library beforehand, [`libbass`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libbass) and [`libbass_fx`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libbass_fx). </br>

Then after that use the [`ext/build.sh`](https://github.com/FireRedz/kurarin/blob/rewrite/ext/build.sh) script to build, no makefile fuckery or something like that.
