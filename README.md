# Kurarin - Nuked [Codename: Dementia]

i nuked literally everything and revamped (almost) the entire codebase...

## Disclaimer

note that this wont be usable (for public uses, although you can "hack" it to make it work) for awhile cuz im busy with school rn...

## Why Dementia

i cant keep up with the old codebase cuz its so bad so yea thats why

## Preview

(Slider is being reworked, so theres no alpha)

## Misc

### Build flags

By default most of these flags are disable to get the best performance out of the engine... although its unstable without it. (its still unstable even with the flags enabled :trollface:)

### Audio

Removed in favour of BASS.

### Graphic

* no_aa [off]: no antialiasing for images
