## Why Dementia

i cant keep up with the old codebase cuz its so bad so yea thats why

## Misc

### Build flags

By default most of these flags are disable to get the best performance out of the engine... although its unstable without it. (its still unstable even with the flags enabled :trollface:)

### Audio

Removed in favour of BASS.

### Graphic
