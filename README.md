## Disclaimer

This is my personal side project so updates is very random.

## Why Dementia

Old codebase is absolute dogshit and full of weird shenanigans, so might as well make everything from scratch again ;). </br>
(New codebase is still bad but atleast its bearable and much more simpler this time)

## Preview

(Slider is being reworked, so theres no alpha)

## Building

### Requirements

* V
* BASS
* OpenGL >= 3.3 (iirc)

#### On Linux (Arch)

You might need to install a few library beforehand, [`libbass`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libbass) and [`libbass_fx`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libbass_fx). </br>

Then after that use the [`ext/build.sh`](https://github.com/FireRedz/kurarin/blob/rewrite/ext/build.sh) script to build, no makefile fuckery or something like that.

#### On Windows 

LOL, you could try [`ext/build.bat`](https://github.com/FireRedz/kurarin/blob/rewrite/ext/build.bat) but I bet my left balls it wont work. </br>
Some of the code just wont work in windows, for [example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/703552229680087042/937958943634890762/windowz_moment.mp4). <br/>
Besides, I use arch (btw) so I dont really have a way to test it on windows without dualbooting or having another machine to test it.
