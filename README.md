## Releases

You can get the latest development build from the CI/CD [here](https://github.com/FireRedz/kurarin/actions/workflows/ci.yml).

## Building

### Requirements

* V
* BASS
* OpenGL >= 3.0

#### On Linux (Arch)

You might need to install a few library beforehand, [`libbass`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libbass) and [`libbass_fx`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libbass_fx). </br>

Then after that use the [`ext/build.sh`](https://github.com/FireRedz/kurarin/blob/rewrite/ext/build.sh) script to build, no makefile fuckery or something like that.
## Credits

Some of the code is _derived_ or literally copy-pasted from these projects, so big credits to them.
