## Disclaimer

This program is far from finished and it's not exactly stable either but it works most of the time. <br/>
Use [danser-go](https://github.com/Wieku/danser-go) or [McOsu](https://github.com/McKay42/McOsu), if you're looking for client alternative.

## Releases

~~You can get the latest development build from the CI/CD
[here](https://github.com/FireRedz/kurarin/actions/workflows/ci.yml).~~ <br />
Build CI is dead rn, [build it yourself](#building) for now.

## Running

```bash
./kurarin [...arguments]
```

## Settings

The program will create a `settings.json` file on startup for the first time, and exit right after. <br/>
The next startup will be normal.

## Features

Currently supports:

- Gameplay (thank you, wieku)
- Auto (+ cursordance, again, thanks wieku)
- Rendering (Requires [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed in `$PATH`)
- Storyboard
<!-- - Replay (`.osr`) support -->

Currently does not support:

- Stable memory management (This program leaks memory currently, especially with sliders.)
- User interface
- Aspire maps

## Building

### Requirements

- V
- GCC/Clang
- OpenGL 3

#### Linux

Tested with Arch but it _should_ work anywhere else as long as it's linux.

Use [`ext/build.sh`](https://github.com/FireRedz/kurarin/blob/rewrite/ext/build.sh) to build the program, no makefile
fuckery or smth like that.
