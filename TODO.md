# TO FUCKING DO

## Important

```md
* Find a way to revert back to using V's gg instead of modding it.
* Refactor the whole codebase
```

## Not so important

## osu! engine

```md
* Remove the random crap that i've been keeping since the start of this project
* Refactor `Beatmap`
* Refactor `Storyboard`
* Generalize `Cursor`
* Refactor the main loop of the whole program
```

## proseka engine

```md
* tbh idk, kinda lost interest in this.
* Slider rendering

```
